Q.   Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

Ans. An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution 
     of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's 
     instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a 
     situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. 
     An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

     Exception handling :

     If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception,
     you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in
     a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement,
     followed by a block of code which handles the problem as 
     elegantly as possible.

     Errors in Python :

     Error in Python can be of two types i.e. 
     Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are problems in 
     a program due to which the program will stop the execution.

Q.      Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is
used for?

Ans.    Runs over entire source tree of the current directory and 
        pulls out all strings marked for translation. It creates 
        a message file in the conf/local directory. You must run this
        command with :
                
                     --locale, --exclude, or --all options
